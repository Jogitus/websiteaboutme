        <p></p>        <h3>Short answer: Just a nerd who wants to learn.</h3>
        <p></p>        <h2>Long answer: My life through zeros and ones.</h2>
                    <p>I cant remember what was our first computer, but my first memories of personal computer is a huge crt on the table and im there playing some thomas the tank engine puzzle game. I was 3 years old at that point.</p>
                    <p>When I was around 6, I learned that my uncle is a gamedev. Back then he worked on a game series called Trials. A motorcycle game. (Nowdays he finnished working on Alan Wake 2 few years ago. and to be honest I dont know what he is working on at the moment.) </p>
                    <p>You can imagine what that seemed like to a kid, he was cooler then anyone. He was also our familys techsupport. (Oh how do I feel hes pain nowdays).</p>
                    <p>I feel bad for my mom, who had to call him every half a year when I had bricked our family computer trying to download a games for free from virus sited and god knows where.</p>
                    <p>So as you might imagine I was not great with computers, but I was addicted to computers.</p>
                    <p>I had to fight with my big sister on who can be on a computer...I was 7 and she was 16. You can imagine her IRCgallery and Windows messenger time was more important then my ass watching smosh, pewdiepie</p>
                    <p>Years went by, I always fought with my little brother on who gets to break moms computer trying to download shit we dont understand.</p>
                    <p>When I was 13 I found counter strike and that was something else. I went on this churchcamp, after that family members give you money and I spend all of that on a new computer.</p>
                    <p>It was such a shit computer intel i5 i think it was 8 or 9 gen, nvidia 960 if I remember correctly, 240gb ssd (ssd is the only thing that is still inside my current build)</p>
                    <p>I had razer deathstalker keyboard, wich was probably the worst gamning keyboard you could get, deathadder 2013 mouse wich was great and then steelseries siberia v2 headset wich was amazing(atleast now remembering it through nostalgia)</p>
                    <p>My monitor was an old tv and I played cs with 30fps, lowest resolutions, 60ping, but I played my hearth out.</p>
                    <p>Ever since I started there was nothing like it. I went straight to my pc when I got home from school, I played cs until my mom yelled me to take my ass to bed.</p>
                    <p>(fun fact right now I have around 8000hours in CS, and I still love the game.) ((I do hate cs2 tho. RIP GO))</p>
                    <p>Back to the times I started CS, I was in secondary school, there was an computer course. It was HTML coding.</p>
                    <p>I fucking sucked at it. I copy pasted everything from my friend who somehow knew how to google shit better then I did.</p>
                    <p>I like how im writing about that course, while doing a html site trying to remember those commands from that course.</p>
                    <p>Now you know I was addicted to computers since I was 7 and now we added addiction of counter strike to the mix.</p>
                    <p>Back then I had great grades,I was planning on going to high school. But then at 14 years old we had a visiting day in a vocational college near my home.</p>
                    <p>First thing I see is a classroom of computers, all the students playing cs 1.6 together. I was hooked. I asked what kind of grades you need to get it.</p>
                    <p>The relief I felt when I heard I could drop my almost 9 grades to an humble 7. That ment the last year of school, I started kicking back, no more sweating. I knew what I wanted and it was to work with computers.</p>
                    <p>I get to the vocational college, I study electronics, electricity, VR, networking, cable making and some more random stuff. To be fair I dont remember alot from these times. For a nerd I spend suprisingly high amount of time drinking and partying.....at 15</p>
                    <p>The studies themself dont really matter on my story, but the work I did when I was training for school. I worked in technical support, first few weeks at phone service, untill they realised I dont know how to do anything.</p>
                    <p>Then I got kicked to onsite support, oh how I loved it. I got my own desk, I started going through tickets. I changed hdmi cables, installed operatingsystems for the first time, touched computer parts for the first time. </p>
                    <p>I learned so much while working there, but I also learned alot about pending the rules from few of my coworkers. I still havent listed the client I worked for and im pretty sure I signed a NDA, but I was 16 who was still partying and playing cs when I wasent drunk or working. I dont remember anything I have signed.</p>
                    <p>Anyways after I spend almost a year working there, I got into a slump in IT. The school didint really teach me those things I wanted to learn, but I was so close to graduate I had to see it through.</p>
                    <p>I think around this time I bought new parts for my PC. I got 10th gen i5, 1080ti, 144hz monitor...I was living and I was gaming.</p>
                    <p>I used to also skip alot of school days to play CS. We lived with my mother and she had to travel alot for her work, so I was home alot.</p>
                    <p>It got so bad she thought I was doing cocain, due to me playing all the nights. She just didint know I was not at school when she was working. I was resting and gathering energy to play some more cs. </p>
                    <p>I graduate and I work part-time as a store clerk. It was nothing special, I worked 3 days a week, so I could play more cs. I got 500/700â‚¬ a month, wich was enough for my energy drinks, ciggs and parties.</p>
                    <p>One day while working at the store I was going out for a smoke, I received a call id I want to help out at the school as a substitute teacher. I said I can come tomorrow and discuss about it. </p>
                    <p>Less then 16hours from that call, I was having my first class, getting paid so much more then in the store. But what did I teach?</p>
                    <p>I started out teaching customerservice and photography basics (I had a filmmaking era when I was a teenager. I was sure id make it to LA before 20.)((I did actually visit LA before 20, but it has nothing to do with this))</p>
                    <p>Year later, I got promoted to head of helpdesk at our school, we changed cables, helped around and so on. School it issues were nothing special.</p>
                    <p>Then i was made an IT-basics teacher, I didint even know much about computers at that time....but lets say I was quick to learn before I gave my own lectures on topics i had studied night before.</p>
                    <p>and from that point, i worked as the youngest teacher in my country teaching people 2-4 times older then me. To this day, when im not the youngest anymore, but i do know more things, I have improved our schools IT-basics (full remodeling).</p>
                    <p>Me and my coworkers changed the whole it-studies in our school compered to the one I was studying few years prior to an high level study of computers and technology.</p>
                    <P>Even if you are young, clueless or lost. Remember that passion, curious hearth and will to risk it all can take you to places you never thought was possible.</P>
                    <p>I remember when I told my parents I got a job as a teacher, they laughed at me to my face. Calling me a dumb and saying how the fuck did you get that. </p>
                    <p>Even after few years of teaching, my grandparents still were in disbelieve I was a teacher. </p>
                    <p>But they did believe it everytime they needed help with their computers.</p>
                    <p>Lets jump to present day.</p>
                    <p>I work 10 hours a day teaching, developing material, meetings and so on. I now teach It basics, operating systems, IBCP Digital Society, IBCP Reflective Project, E-sports and more </p>
                    <p>After my work, I eat and then study my university studies for 2-3 hours, after that im in bed reading my book untill I pass out. Mostly day to day life is from 6:30-21:30. </p>
                    <p>I also run a weekly chessclub. Im terrible at chess, but I do love the game. All of the lads beat me, but I have these rare games I am in the zone and win few games. I am way better in chess960. </p>
                    <p>Nowdays I run a NAS on rasberry-pi, I have my own servercabin in my home office, there is only a switch at the moment, but it will evolve at somepoint. I got antennas on my balcony for stronger signal, on my table there is still an old CRT. My computer can run 99% any game, but I dont have time to play anymore.</p>
                    <p>I use close to no social media (Snapchat for my girlfriend & youtube....well for videos. I love youtube.), I try to avoid google,microsoft and other big companies and support opensource the best I can. Someday I can delete my linkedin and say good bye to my outlook emails and microsoft authenticator I must use for work.</p>
                    <p>Thats not all, but I think you get the picture from that. I try to stay as private as I can (Funny to say this after over 40 lines about my life, pushing it to the internet. But you get the point.)</p>
                    <p>Newest update to my setup is few days ago I started using Omarchy wich is a hyprland+arch based linux distro made by DHH.</p>
                    <p>Im pretty sure I forgot alot. I might add things later.</p>
                    <p>Remembered one thing. I dont like A.I, like a line from No Game No Life, first anime I saw at 14 or 15 states "I support humanity."</p>
                    <p>Also in 2019 I saw a youtube short documentary that changed my passion for IT. Cicada 3301. </p>
