                <h4>Important disclaimers</h4>
                <p>1. I stated I used chatgpt in my past engineering studies. This time, I have not used AI for my studies in HAMK. I even removed inlineSuggest from VScode, I want to hardcode everything myself. Even if it's slower and harder. It's just the only way I will learn. </p>
                <p>2. I do not support A.I all together. Thats just me and my opinion. There is alot more I dont support in tech, but thats for aboutme.</p>
