                    <h3>OperatingSystemBasics Course</h3>
                    <p>This topic was kind of easy, the course only had 4 different exams you needed to finnish to pass the course.</p>
                    <p>First up was Linux. I have been messing with Linux distros for few years so basic ubuntu tasks were easy. We needed to run apache server on virtualbox and then take putty access to it. after that run few basic commands.</p>
                    <p>Windows was up next. MMC, user/group permissions, Powershell. Powershell scripting was little bit hard, but I managed to work with it.</p>
                    <p>Third was Virtualisation...it felt like a joke. WSL, kali, ubuntu, hyper-V, I have been teaching these for years so I dusted the section is less then 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Last but not least Docker.This exam is the only one giving me trouble. I tried to do it,but nothing works at all. I tried to get it working with different manuals, stackoverflow, forums....nope. Just have to wait few weeks untill I can ask my teacher few questions about it.</p>
                    <p>So I got docker task done...there was a problem in the task given to us. A typo in the material....after I got root password for mysql image, I was done with the tasks in two hours.</p>
                    <p>Grade I got: 5/5</p>
            <p></p>    
                    <h3>Programming basics</h3> 
                    <p>We started with Java. I have now been writing code with it for around a month and I am truly enjoying it.</p>
                    <p>Right now we gone through: Sequence structure, control structures, Variables, Selection structures, if statements, How to generat random numbers,  User inputs, Loops, Arrays & Lists and Methods. </p>
                    <p>I have posted almost everything we have gone through to my Github. The code is ugly, but if you are interessted in what First course of University of applied sciences programming looks like <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Jogitus/">You can see it here.</a> </p>
                    <p>(In my past engineering studies we had C as the first language...yeah ChatGPT helped alot back then.)</p>
                    <p>I was one out of maybe 3 students who got full points in the proggramming exam, but I missed an assignment wich dropped my grade by 1. Im so pissed about it.</p>
                    <p>Grade I got: 4/5</p>
            <p></p>        
                    <h3>Swedish Course 1</h3>
                    <p>This language has been the source of my academic suffering for over a decade now.</p>
                    <p>Atleast we have had few group projects with "like minded" classmates, so it's actually been quite fun.</p>
                    <p>I have already stated many times, I will sweat all the classes I will take to get perfect grades (5 is maximum grade here.)</p>
                    <p>But for Swedish language, im ready to take a 1. All I need is to pass it one last time. Then im free from it. </p>
                    <p>We had 2 different recordings we needed to do for this course, we just hopped to discord and made some random shit. It was fun tho! we laughed so much during the recording its a miracle we passed.</p>
                    <p>We also had to write few papers in swedish.</p>
                    <p>Grade I got: passed</p>
