                    <h3 class="sivuotsikko">Operating Systems Basics</h3>
                <p class ="small">
                    Topics: 1. Linux basics, 2. Powershell basics 3. Virtualization  4. Docker basics<br>
                    This topic was kind of easy, the course only had 4 different exams you needed to finnish to pass the course.<br>
                    First up was Linux. I have been messing with Linux distros for few years so basic ubuntu tasks were easy.<br>
                    We needed to run apache server on virtualbox and then take putty access to it. after that run few basic commands.<br>
                    Windows was up next. MMC, user/group permissions, Powershell. Powershell scripting was little bit hard, but I managed to work with it.<br>
                    Third was Virtualisation...it felt like a joke.<br>
                    WSL, kali, ubuntu, hyper-V, I have been teaching these for years so I dusted the section is less then 30 minutes.<br>
                    Last but not least Docker.This exam is the only one giving me trouble.<br>
                    I tried to do it,but nothing works at all.<br>
                    I tried to get it working with different manuals, stackoverflow, forums....nope.<br>
                    Just have to wait few weeks untill I can ask my teacher few questions about it.<br>
                    So I got docker task done...there was a problem in the task given to us.<br>
                    A typo in the material....after I got root password for mysql image, I was done with the tasks in two hours.<br>
                    Grade I got: 5/5

                    <h3 class="sivuotsikko">Programming basics</h3>
                <p class ="small">
                    We started with Java. I have now been writing code with it for around a month and I am truly enjoying it.<br>
                    Topics in the basics:<br>
                    Variables, Sequence/Control/Selection structures, if/else/do/while statements,  User inputs, Loops, Arrays & Lists and Methods.<br>
                    I have posted almost everything we have gone through to my Github.<br>
                    The code is ugly, but if you are interessted in what programming basics for HAMK looks like <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Pihajoki/">You can click here.</a><br>
                    (In my past engineering studies we had C as the first language...yeah ChatGPT helped alot back then.)<br>
                    I was one out of few students in my class who got full points in the programming exam, but I missed an assignment wich dropped my grade by 1.<br>
                    Im so pissed about it.<br>
                    Grade I got: 4/5

                    <h3 class="sivuotsikko">Swedish Course 1</h3>
                    <p class="small">
                    This language has been the source of my academic suffering for over a decade now.<br>
                    Atleast we have had few group projects with "like minded" classmates, so it's actually been quite fun.<br>
                    I have already stated many times, I will sweat all the classes I will take to get perfect grades (5 is maximum grade here.)<br>
                    But for Swedish language, im ready to take a 1. All I need is to pass it one last time. Then im free from it. <br>
                    We had 2 different recordings we needed to do for this course, we just hopped to discord and made some random shit.<br>
                    It was fun tho! we laughed so much during the recording its a miracle we passed.<br>
                    We also had to write few papers in swedish.<br>
                    Grade I got: passed
