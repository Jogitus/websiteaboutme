                <h3 class="sivuotsikko">Database Basics</h3>
                <p class ="small">
                This was divided to two parts. 1. Database design. 2. SQL Queries.<br>
                The database design part had me lost for a moment, but eventually understood it.<br>
                Most isuses I had with M:M relationships and how to make them 1:M.<br>
                Got full score on the test. Exam time: 44 minutes<br>
                The SQL Queries was an easier one, It had a simple logic.<br>
                I just watched a 20 minute video about it before the exam, never opened the material nor did any practice excersices.<br>
                I did get only 9/10 points on the exam, which pissed me off for 2 days.<br>
                I was trying to retrieve data from a wrong column for 1h40mins and didint realise it.<br>
                Exam time: 2 hours 46 minutes for 10 questions.<br>
                Grade I got: 5/5

                <h3 class="sivuotsikko">Networking & Cybersecurity Basics</h3>
                <p class ="small">
                This was divided to 5 parts.<br>
                1. Network schema design for a small company. 2. UFW-Firewall configuration. 3. Traefik. 4. Tailscale. 5. HackTheBox "courses"<br>
                Most of my time on this course was spend on learning about networks, which I didint understand at all.<br>
                I spend roughly 50 hours studying them.<br>
                Went through cisco network basics, comptia networking+ book, NetworkChucks "You suck at subnetting"-series (It was great).<br>
                The actual schema was easy to do. It took me 50minutes.<br>
                I felt for a moment that I wasted my time learning all these things, but I am very happy I did, because networking is kinda important u know<br>
                The UFW-Firewall was an easy task, took me like 5 minutes to get it done.<br>
                I worked on Traefik assignment for 4 hours.<br>
                untill I realised I needed an Ubuntu WSL for the assignment...Lets just say I didint have it on my Arch.<br>
                So I went to bed, next day booted to windows<br>
                (Thank God I post everything on github, so I didint have to start all over and could just pull my .yaml file and continue)<br>
                It took me like 2 hours to finnish, so 6 hours combined.<br>
                Tailscale was another easy assignment, Got it done in 50 minutes or so.<br>
                We needed to get it working with the Traefik we did in previouse assignment & access the Traefik sites from another device.<br>
                (Traefik was run in Docker)<br>
                In HackTheBox we need to finnish three different "Courses".<br>
                I had spend all my points months ago, so I have to finnish random modules to be able to finnish these ones for the course :D<br>
                1.Introduction to the Academy (I finnished this months ago, when I was curious of HackTheBox)<br>
                2. Getting started Nothing special, was a bit tricky. (Now I cant do SQL injections because I lost the instance. Have to finnish tomorrow.)<br>
                3.SQL Injection Fundamentals Nothing special, finnished in one evening. Was an interessting topic tho.<br>
                Grade I got: 5/5

                <h3 class="sivuotsikko">Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
                <p class ="small">
                Fun fact: This is my third or fourth time doing OOP in Uni.<br>
                Last time I was in Engineering studies and had C++. (To be fair, I didint learn any programming before taking those courses.)<br>
                Topics:<br>
                class, object, constructor, abstract class/methods, encapsulation, inheritance, static methods/attributes,
                I actually finnished this course in one sitting.<br>
                I didint program anything for 1.5 months, yesterday I thought: "I have the OOP test in 4 days, maybe I should finnish this course."<br>
                I spend 13 hours making a "cheat sheet", a single file with everything we had in this course.<br>
                Idea was that I can just copy+paste from it and change the names for the assignments and exams.<br>
                You can see it here: <a href="https://github.com/Pihajoki/OlioPohja/blob/master/Pohja/src/App.java"> OOP-CheatSheet.</a><br>
                Assignments were easy, finnished them all in 2 hours. It was 11 code assignments. (Nothing super complicated)<br>
                The cheatsheet ended up being quite useless.<br>
                I ended up doing all the assignments without it, due to going them over and over again for 13 hours, you kinda learn the topic :D<br>
                Exam was 2 parts and had to be finnished in 3 hours.<br>
                In the theory part of the exam there was few questions about OOP, which were easy questions. So it took me less then 5 minutes to fill.<br>
                In the code part, there was 3 codes you needed to write.<br>
                First 2 codes I finnished in 15 minutes, but I battled with the last one for over 2 hours.<br>
                I did not get it right due to having a typo in one of the lines. So ended the course with grade 4.<br>
                I will redo the exam at the end of the month. Lets see if I can raise my number to 5.<br>
                The resit exam was easy. I finnished it in 38minutes while eating pizza<br>
                <a href="https://github.com/Pihajoki/OOP-ResitTest">You can see the test here.</a><br>
                I havent written java or even thought about OOP in over a month.<br>
                But I am very happy with the results.<br>
                Grade I got: 4/5<br>
                Fixed grade: 5/5

                <p class="small">
                I really disliked this course.<br>
                Have pretty much nothing to tell you, took like 2 evenings to work on it.<br>
                This course was scheduled at christmas break (Both uni & my work had a break at the same time.)<br>
                Was great that had "time to do it", but there was better things to do like finally relax after full fall semester of working & studying<br>
                We needed to go through a dataset, and I chose to work with chess openings.<br>
