                <h3>Databases Basics</h3>
                <p>This was divided to two parts. 1. Database design. 2. SQL Queries.</p>
                <p>The database design part had me lost for a moment, but eventually understood it. Most isuses I had with M:M relationships and how to make them 1:M. Got full score on the test. Exam time: 44 minutes</p>
                <p>The SQL Queries was an easier one, It had a basic logic and I just watched a 20 minute video about it before the exam, never opened the material nor did any practice excersices.</p>
                <p>I did get only 9/10 points on the exam, which pissed me off for 2 days. I was trying to retrieve data from a wrong column for 1h40mins and didint realise it. Exam time: 2 hours 46 minutes for 10 questions.</p>
                <p>Grade I got: 5/5</p>
        <p></p>
                <h3>Networking & Cybersecurity Basics</h3> 
                <p>This was divided to 5 parts. 1. Network schema design for a small company. 2. UFW-Firewall configuration. 3. Traefik. 4. Tailscale. 5. HackTheBox "courses"</p>
                <p>Most of my time on this course was spend on learning about networks, which I didint understand at all. I spend roughly 50 hours studying them.</p>
                <p>Went through cisco network basics, comptia networking+ book, NetworkChucks "You suck at subnetting"-series (It was great).</p>
                <p>The actual schema was easy to do. It took me 50minutes. I felt for a moment that I wasted my time learning all these things, but I am very happy I did, because networking is kinda important u know></p>
                <p>The UFW-Firewall was an easy task, took me like 5 minutes to get it done.</p>
                <p>I worked on Traefik assignment for 4 hours, untill I realised I needed an Ubuntu WSL for the assignment...Lets just say I didint have it on my Arch.</p>
                <p>So I went to bed, next day booted to windows (Thank God I didint have to start all over and could just open .yaml file and continue)</p>
                <p>It tooke me like 2 hours to finnish, so 6 hours combined.</p>
                <p>Tailscale was another easy assignment, Got it done in 50 minutes or so. We needed to get it working with the Traefik we did in previouse assignment & access the Traefik sites from another device.</p>
                <p>(Traefik was run in Docker)</p>
                <p>In HackTheBox we need to finnish three different "Courses". I had spend all my points months ago, so I have to finnish random modules to be able to finnish these ones for the course :D</p>
                <p>1. Introduction to the Academy (I finnished this months ago, when I was curious of HackTheBox)</p>
                <p>2. Getting started Nothing special, was a bit tricky. (Now I cant do SQL injections because I lost the instance. Have to finnish tomorrow.)</p>
                <p>SQL Injection Fundamentals Nothing special, finnished in one evening. Was an interessting topic tho.</p>
                <p>Grade I got: 5/5</p>
        <p></p>
                <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
                <p>This is my third or fourth time doing OOP in Uni. Last time I was in Engineering studies and had C++. (To be fair, I didint learn programming back then)</p>
                <p>I actually finnished this course in one sitting. I didint program anything for 1.5 months, yesterday was the day I decided "I have the OOP test in 4 days, maybe I should finnish this course."</p>
                <p>I spend 13 hours making a "cheat sheet", a single file with everything we had in this course. Idea was that I can just copy+paste from it and change the names for the assignments and exams.</p>
                <p>You can see it here: <a href="https://github.com/Pihajoki/OlioPohja/blob/master/Pohja/src/App.java"> OOP-CheatSheet.</a></p>
                <p>Assignments were easy, finnished them all in 2 hours. It was 11 code assignments. (Nothing super complicated)</p>
                <p>The cheatsheet ended up being quite useless. I ended up doing all the assignments without it, due to going them over and over again for 13 hours, you kinda learn while doing it :D</p>
                <p>Exam was 2 parts and had to be finnished in 3 hours.</p>
                <p>In the theory part of the exam there was few questions about OOP, which were easy questions. So it took me less then 5 minutes to fill.</p>
                <p>In the code part, there was 3 codes you needed to write.</p>
                <p>First 2 codes I finnished in 15 minutes, but I battled with the last one for over 2 hours.</p>
                <p>I did not get it right due to having a typo in one of the lines. So ended the course with grade 4.</p>
                <p>Im still thinking about going to redo the exam, so I can get grade 5.</p>
                <p>Grade I got: 4/5</p>
        <p></p>
                <h3>Basics of Analytics</h3>
                <p>I really disliked this course.</p>
                <p>We needed to go through a dataset, and I chose to work with chess openings.</p>

                <p>Grade I got: /5</p>
